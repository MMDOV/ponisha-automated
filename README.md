   ```

## Usage
To run the tool, first configure the `data.yml` file with your user information and the message you want to send. You can then run the application with:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will log you into Ponisha and find new projects to automatically send requests.

## Features
- Automatic login to Ponisha
- Finding the first available project
- Automatically sending requests to projects
- Configurable filters for project selection

## Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries:
- [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) (version 4.18.1)
- [pyYAML](https://pyyaml.org)

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
The tool uses a `data.yml` configuration file to store your user information and request message. This file is automatically generated if not found.

## Examples
For example, you can populate the `data.yml` file with the following:
```yaml
message: "Hello, I'm ready to complete this project."
user_name: "email@example.com"
password: "yourpassword"
```

Then, by running the tool, it will automatically send your message to the first available project.
